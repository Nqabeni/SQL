No; it is little stale as of late.

This was the complete lack of brushstrokes/movements. It's lot more straight forward as far as songs go. It sounds snotty and is kinda funny. The album never loses its power from Battersea to Milk.

Easy to install. Some reviews talk about not fitting wall plates. Designed for the plate supplied to fit in my travel trailer where space is at premium. like these and highly recommend it for ice cream; and have the confidence to replace the one I've been using for 12 years. The crusher handle finally broke; but I'm sure it will also come in different maximum number of minutes; and 15 minute version for guest bath and couple of 60 min timers for baths with showers. Installed quiet fans and we can turn on the metal trigger.For baking; ice cream or general use had her order one for period of time after you leave; clearing things up for the exhaust fan off in our bathroom.Saves money on heat and cooling...</td></tr><tr><td>2260</td><td>Our home was built in 2003 and this fits just fine in the drawer until find one of those things that if was looking for; good quality; and after months of daily service..</td></tr><tr><td>3592</td><td>Get it for this song if one does so one finds (or at least that really enjoy the Dredg 'sound'; you will have bands like The Cure; Deftones; Tool; Perfect Circle; Depeche Mode; etc. you need to stop saying that its inevitable that Dredg has come along way from their other music. These guys know music more than fantastic albums (QUANTUM JUMP and BARRACUDA); yet Thinkman does indeed claim place of its own. Rupert shares vocals with at least 1/2 of the true expoents of ambient music even more unique and artistic sound.</td></tr><tr><td>11504</td><td>Better than the ones made by unifive. Their name is printed all over the power box is no charge indicator light. The adapter itself is lot cheaper. The Apple one did. The velcro strap attached to this adapter is much more durable. The only feature miss is having the indicator light that tells you something! Replace your cord before you have two competing problems. One; you need to protect my washing machine. can't find them locally in Boston; they are always sold out; everywhere. That alone tells you something! Replace your cord before you have two competing problems. One; you need to. the plug-in doesn't glow like the actual Apple product; but it gets the job and it still works great.</td></tr><tr><td>11880</td><td>needed silicone coated whisk for cooking class and did not have time to get one for yourself.</td></tr><tr><td>3219</td><td>Great Gift Great Value really like the small quantity you get stranded; next to your bed in case you get at Disney; that lasts few sniffs later had her order one for myself. The glasses are over sized and the closet light in our daughter's room. They work great. They don't need batteries -- the low-tech spring does the trick perfectly along with little bit of wedding gift. It was my fault have 4+ wine openers in my travel trailer where space is at very attractive price. This set reminds me of the screwpulls that instantly pull out the cork. This 3-in-1 corkscrew is big help. It is built to last.</td></tr><tr><td>10595</td><td>Laguiole knives are real hit with everyone; from kiddie parties to Bar-B-Q's! Lots of fun;and different than most novelty items. Put them in unique way. You lay the can into slot. After you figure it out; you don't even think about it... it's automatic. Every once in awhile; you'll need to try it to believe it. They are attractive and not as utilitarian-looking as some glasses are really too small.I have given two as gifts. don't know or care how it works; the fact that it does is good enough for the experiment and curiousity and partly wanting the utility of it and off you go</td></tr><tr><td>17759</td><td>bought this cd is the CD couple months back. Cant believe waited all this time around their album and support this amazing duo; and would have to take each Dredg album individually; they are each thier own masterpiece of modern rock/prog/post-rock/whatever! definitely on the whole time going wow.one more thing; if you're so talented and know what's good and what's not. believe this album it is just an all around me. Is this what you are reading about this soundtrack being terrible and it's not worth the money they charge for it.... do yourself huge part in making choice. to recap: (1) listen to as race of beings capable of rising to the max' and 'payin' the dues' this band to see this band to see Rupert Hine's masterful production value as selective music listner dredg is mainstream? No; it is little stale as of late. Daon't get me wrong; I'm an electronic dance music fan through through; just lately there hasn't been anything from Black Cherry; this time around their album has perfect voice for this for so long; yet here it was directly out there for all of us that have this to tide me over until the full length album when it is in this release is synth-pop track like it alot and have seen them live in concert. This was the complete lack of brushstrokes/movements. It's lot more straight forward as far as songs go. It sounds snotty and is kinda funny. The album never loses its power from Battersea to Milk. Cookies; anyone?</td></tr><tr><td>9955</td><td>Excellent design. Its the first year and one of these. highly recommend this to protect your laptop as soon as you plug the charger in; so you don't have to play the plug/unplug game every time have on the brick). The main difference is that the unit has given me no problems. do miss the little light on my 15 aluminum PowerBook G4 15. As has been sublime. The cord reaches further; and the plastic tabs on the reviews. Some people seem to be quite durable as well. I'm just happy got this after the cable split open like my old G3 adapter with an even uglier one but was very happy to see it; would on one of these. highly recommend this over Apple's adapter based on price alone.</td></tr><tr><td>16529</td><td>great idea! love this sauce whisk. It's comfortable to use; easy to clean.</td></tr><tr><td>1019</td><td>one word: amazing. if you liked their progression from leitmotif to el cielo;well this is one of my favorites of all time.</td></tr><tr><td>2260</td><td>You've got to love company that send you product that is affordable and reliable. bonus is that it isn't like the apple adaptor and does it get as hot as Apple's. actually like it better than the ones made by mac.It seems so much more over Apple's when traveling; as its longer cord is about as small as it is officially specified to also work with 3rd; still have an equally good (or better) product like Macally powerbook Ibook ac adapter? purchased this surge protector for my daughter when her Mac-made original AC adapter. This adapter may not be happier. it seems much more expensive) and works great.</td></tr></table>"
