## Table of contents

Wondering what's here?

- **sql-cs**: Here you'll find resources from a presentation titled "Leveraging AI in SQL Server 2019". This presentation covers putting SQL Server 2019 ML Services + Java Extensibility, Cognitive Services, and Containers together in ways that make sense in the real world.
- **sql-ml**: Here you'll find resources from a presentation titled "SQL Server ML End-to-End". This presentation covers using Python and/or TSQL to go through the Team Data Science Process to perform in-database machine learning.
- **sql-cs-icc**: Here you'll find the resources from a presentation "Adding AI to your SQL Server Applications with Containerized Cognitive Services" at the Intelligent Cloud Conference. This presentation is similar to the sql-cs presentation above, except it goes deeper into creating LUIS models, and deploying containers with them.
